            <div class="section-content">
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Over the last ten years, I have been working in two different fields simultaneously, community-based activism and health research.
                    I have been working with a non-profit youth organization in Bangladesh on building an environmental movement.
                    Besides, I worked with international development agencies and public health research institutions on diverse issues such as gender and equity, access to immunization and healthcare, zoonotic diseases, and human-centered design.
                    My current Ph.D. project on the growing prevalence of uterus infections and hysterectomies (uterus removal surgery) in the southern coast of Bangladesh is bringing together my work in environmental activism and health research.

                    I am conducting fieldwork in Shyamnagar, a subdistrict under Satkhira District in Bangladesh.
                    Satkhira is located on the southern coast of Bangladesh.
                    The region is known for climate vulnerability and frequent natural disasters (predominantly cyclones and floods).
                    Polder water management and commercial shrimp cultivation have drastically increased groundwater salinity in the region, leading to an extreme crisis of fresh water for drinking and personal hygiene.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    For my master's thesis on infertility treatment in Bangladesh, I worked with ten women on their quest for conception.
                    During the fieldwork, I realized compassion and respect could open windows to discussing issues we consider taboo or difficult.
                    It is also ok for an ethnographer to be uncomfortable and vulnerable.
                    The process of doing ethnography is valuable for both ethnographer and the interlocutors.

                    My guilty pleasure is watching recipes on YouTube and trying those for my wife and son.
